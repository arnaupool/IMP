This is my best take at the problem, I don't know why my percentage is lower than the one provided.

3spheres.stl:
    Provided statement: Overhangs = 49,11 %
    My solution:        Overhang  = 44.07 %

The out.stl file provided in this .zip is the result of the execution of the program with 3spheres.stl. As you can see, it's almost
the same as the image you sent us of your solution.

My guess is that there may be a flaw in the logic of my program, but I can't seem to wrap my head about it.
